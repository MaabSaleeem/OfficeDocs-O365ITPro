# Kaizala public groups

Kaizala public groups allow enterprises to expose a single channel on Kaizala, where they can connect privately with a large set of Kaizala subscribers to share and receive information and provide updates.
    
## Create a public group

After a public group is created, you can add more admins and members.
  
## Add subscribers

After you create a public group, you can add subscribers to it. Once subscribers have been added, they will start to see the public groupin in Kaizala.
  
- To add subscribers, select a public group, and click **Add Subscribers**. You can only add subscribers using a CSV file. This allows you to add subscribers in bulk.
    
- On the **Add Subscribers** page, download the CSV template and follow the format to add your subscribers. Save your file when you're done. [Add several users at the same time to Office 365 - Admin Help](https://support.office.com/article/1f5767ed-e717-4f24-969c-6ea9d412ca88#__toc316652088).
    
- Click **Select File** to choose the file you just saved and then click **Add**.

## Invite subscribers

You can also invite subscribers by sending them a generated link. Users can then click on the link to join the public group as subscribers.
  
- To invite subscribers, select a public group, and click on **Generate invite link**.
    
- Copy and send the link to the people you want subscribed to the public group. Once they click on the link, they get subscribed to the group.

Public groups are managed through Kaizala Management Portal by public group admins. Organization group admins can manage all public groups in their organization.
