# Kaizala mobile app

Microsoft Kaizala is a secure chat and messaging app that enables mobile users to send instant messages, Kaizala Actions and attachments such as pictures, documents, videos, audios and more. Microsoft Kaizala also lets you get instant feedback from your users about anything you want. With Kaizala Actions, you can send out polls and surveys to any number of users (few or thousands). All subsequent responses are automatically aggregated and presented in an easy-to-view report, which helps in decision making.
  
## Install Microsoft Kaizala on a mobile device

[Get Kaizala for your mobile phone.](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=851074)
  
Microsoft Kaizala is supported on the following devices:
  
- Android phones running Android 4.3 or higher
    
- iOS phones running iOS 9.0 or higher
    
- Windows phones running Windows 10 version 10240.0 or higher
    
You'll need a wireless or data connection to the internet to use Microsoft Kaizala. Microsoft Kaizala doesn't support tablets which are Wi-Fi only.
  
## Verify your phone number

You must be able to receive phone calls and text messages on the phone number you are trying to verify. A Microsoft Kaizala account can only be verified on one phone number, on one device. If you try to use Kaizala with the same phone number on multiple phones, you'll be logged out from the previous phones, and all Kaizala data on the previous devices will be deleted.
  
## Manage your profile and work account in Kaizala

Change your profile in the Kaizala app by going to the **Profile** page. You can change info like your picture, display name and your email address. You can also sign in with your Office 365 account from **Profile**. When you sign in with your Office 365 work or school account, other Kaizala users in your organization will be able to see you and collaborate with you. You'll see an **Organization** page where you can initiate a chat or create a group. 
  
## Find Contacts and Start chatting

Find your phonebook contacts using Kaizala, and initiate a 1:1 conversation with them. 
  
1. Go to **People**
    
2. Search for any phonebook contact, and if your contact is using Kaizala:
    
  - Click or tap on the contact's image to view their profile summary.
    
  - Click or tap on the contact name to start an instant message conversation.
    
You can also quickly send an invite to any contact that's not using Kaizala. If your contact isn't on Kaizala, click or tap on **Invite** to send a SMS to invite the contact to install Kaizala. 
  
## Start a chat on the Kaizala mobile app

- Go to **Chats** \> **+** \> **Start a chat**
    
- Click or tap on any contact name to start an instant message conversation.
    
You can find all your recent conversations inside the **Chat** section and can also start/resume an instant message conversation from there.

2. You can either add  people or other groups to your new group. Tap contact names or a group and then click on **Next** to add them to your new group. You'll see a pop-up letting you know you can invite them to Kaizala later, if they're not a member of your organization. Tap **OK** to continue. 
    
3. Give your group a name, add a picture if you want and then tap on **Create** to finish.

## Using Kaizala Actions

You can send **Actions** by tapping on the \<palette\> icon from the top right corner of a conversation. Built-in Kaizala Actions help you coordinate frequently used tasks for common workflow scenarios. You can find and use Kaizala Actions from the **Discover** page in the app. The available Kaizala Actions  include: 
  
- **Announcement** Use announcements to make key announcements or share updates with your team. Announcements are a great way to share a message across groups in your organization or in a public group. Engage with your audience about the announcement using likes and comments. 
    
- **Job** Chat messages used to assign jobs to people and track their completion status. The person who creates the job or the person to whom the job is assigned can add quick comments to indicate the progress of the work. Other members of the group can also comment on the job and status. 
    
- **Let's Meet** Used to send quick meeting invitations. The invitee can respond to the invite within the chat and confirm whether they can meet. 
    
- **Live Location** Use this Kaizala action to request for the location of a colleague or a friend. Users get a choice to share their location with you for a specified duration of time and you can track their location in real-time. 
    
- **Photo with Location** The Photo with Location action allows you to share real-time photo information with others, along with the GPS coordinates to show where the photo was taken. For example, with a single tap, team members can share a geo-tagged picture with others to confirm that a specific task has been completed, at a specific location. It can also be used for location-based attendance. 
    
- **Share Location** This action allows you to share location of your team members or phonebook contacts using Kaizala. This helps in coordinating with all team members. 
    
- **Quick Poll** With Quick Poll actions, you can design a custom poll to gather information from your team or from your customers. Respondents can then respond to the poll quickly and easily. Responses are updated in real-time and when the responses are captured, they are presented in an easy-to-read way. You can also create poll questions with pre-defined responses. 
    
- **Request Location** Allows you to request the current location of Kaizala users. This helps in areas of marking attendance, tracking the presence of your team at any point in time. 
    
- **Submit Bill** Allows you to quickly capture the photo of an invoice and share it with details. 
    
- **Survey** A poll and a survey are similar in many ways but do have the following differences: 
    
  -  In a poll, you can ask only one question. In a survey you can ask multiple questions. 
    
  - In a poll, you can only set a multiple choice option for a response, but in a survey you can choose multiple formats for responses: multiple choice, text, choose numbers or even an image.
    
- **Checklist** Checklist action allows you to share a list of tasks with a person or a group, and have them individually complete each task.

## I'm seeing "Upgrade now to use this feature" when I'm trying to use Kaizala

This means that the message you received isn't supported by the version of Kaizala that you are using. Most likely, you will have received this from another user who is running a newer version of Kaizala.
  
- In order to resolve this and to see the message you have received, please upgrade Kaizala to the latest version from the app store.
