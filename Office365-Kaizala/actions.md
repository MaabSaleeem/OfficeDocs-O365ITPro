# Kaizala Actions

Kaizala Action is a 'unit of work' that helps users get work done within a conversation context inside Kaizala. Some of these Actions like Job, Survey and Poll are shipped out-of-the-box, and provide scoped functionality. Once you publish an Action, users can find it in the Kaizala app, and then it can be used in a conversation context from the Action Palette.
  
You can design a custom Kaizala Action through the Action Designer interface within Kaizala management portal by building on the out-of-box Survey Action.
