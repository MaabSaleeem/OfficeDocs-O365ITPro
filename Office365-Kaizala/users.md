# Kaizala users

Before you can send instant messages, pictures and documents, or setup a new poll or survey, you'll have to create Kaizala users. You can add users individually or in bulk. For managing users in groups, check out [Kaizala groups](groups.md).
  
## View all users in an organization
<a name="__top"> </a>

On the Kaizala management portal, from the left navigation pane, choose **Users**. You'll see a list of all users that have possible access to your organization. This list contains all users who have either been: 
  
- uploaded directly through the **Upload User** process
or 
- by being a member of any organization groups mapped to your organization. 
    
You can also select up to 4 columns that can be shown for each user, by clicking on **More** \> **Select Columns**.

Kaizala organization admins can define and manage user attributes for the organization. You can add custom user attributes (employee ID, manager, etc) via the Kaizala Management Portal which makes it easier for admins and other users to identify a user.
  
### Set up attributes for all users in the organization

- Click or tap **Users** \> **More**, and then select **Change Attributes** from the drop-down menu. 
    
- To add a new attribute, click on **Add New** and then select from a range of pre-defined suggested attributes, or add a new attribute. 
    
    ![Screenshot: Change attributes on Kaizala users, like name, phone number and job title.](media/661ce7d7-0ef7-4c40-a850-31fa44aed4ee.png)
  
  - For a list item selected from suggested attributes, you can select whether an attribute is mandatory or optional for users to enter data for.
    
  - For a custom attribute, you can enter the name of the attribute, select the type of attribute (string, number, Yes/No and date/time), and select whether the attribute is mandatory or optional for users to enter data for.
    
  - Once you've made changes to the attribute, click **+** to add it to the list, or **-** to remove it 
    
  - You can add multiple attributes at once.
    
- Once you've finalized the list of attributes, click **Save** to add the new changes to the organization's attribute list. 
    
## Add users in bulk to your organization
