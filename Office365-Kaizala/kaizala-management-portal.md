# Kaizala management portal

Microsoft Kaizala is a secure chat and messaging app that enables mobile users to send instant messages, Kaizala Actions and attachments such as pictures, documents, videos, audios and more. Microsoft Kaizala also lets you get instant feedback from your users about anything you want. With Kaizala Actions, you can send out polls and surveys to any number of users (a few or thousands). All subsequent responses are automatically aggregated and presented in an easy-to-view report, which helps in decision making.
  
[Download Kaizala for your mobile phone](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=851074), and learn about how to use the mobile app here: [About the Kaizala mobile app](kaizala-mobile-app.md).
  
## Access the Kaizala management portal

To access the Kaizala management portal, sign in with your Azure active directory account here: [Kaizala Management Portal](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=852455). Once you are successfully logged in, you'll be asked to add your phone number to Kaizala. After your phone number gets authenticated, you will be able to manage Kaizala via the management portal. 
  
> [!IMPORTANT]
> You can add more than one phone number to the Azure Active Directory admin account. You can switch between these phone numbers in **Settings** to manage Kaizala groups and users respectively.
  
## Kaizala management portal

The Kaizala management portal is a web based portal that provides access to management, reporting and extensibility features of Kaizala. In order to use the portal, you will need a subscription. Using it, your organization can quickly onboard thousands, even millions of users to Kaizala, including employees, partners, vendors, or customers, using just a phone number. You can create Kaizala groups, add users and also view out-of-the-box reports for Kaizala Actions such as Jobs and Surveys. 
  
The Kaizala management portal can be used by the following users:
  
- **IT administrators**  Can use the portal to set up groups and manage users within these groups in a secure and compliant manner. For example, an administrator can add or remove users from a specific group, or remove a user from all organization groups; this is especially useful when an employee leaves and the organization has to ensure that they don't have access to organization groups and/or data, post-departure.
    
- **Developers**  Can use the portal to either create a new Kaizala Action, or customize it. Developers can also add new connectors to integrate their internal or external systems with Kaizala. 
    
- **Business User**  Can view built-in reports, with real-time data updates, for Kaizala Actions shared in organization groups.
